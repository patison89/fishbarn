The Fish Barn is located on a farm in a rural location on the outskirts of Crawley West Sussex.

We have a great selection of high quality F1 and tank bred Rift lake Cichlids and a great selection of Wild caught South American species direct from the Amazon River and itâ€™s many tributaries,
which includes Plecos, Corydoras, Dwarf Cichlids, larger Cichlids, Characins of all sorts and catfish.

We now stock a good range of community fish for the beginner through to the expert fish keeper.
